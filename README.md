# CS_105_Final_Project

This was the project for my introductory computer science class. This game used two special libraries in order to implement additional features. We used OpenCV to 
allow usage of the camera and pygame for the graphical elements. The goal of this game was to teach children colors by asking them to find objects that matched the 
prompt. There are multiple difficulties and a demo mode to demonstrate its capabilities.
